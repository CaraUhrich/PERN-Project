            <h1>Welcome to Nonantum Gallery!</h1>
            <p>The Nonantum Gallery was born in the spring of 2020, when Boston-area roommates Cara, Kirsten, and Ryanne began painting regularly as a way to stay sane during quarantine. Afternoons making a mess of their kitchen soon transformed into evenings painting on Zoom with future-roommate Jenny, who was staying with family in Maine. Over the years since, these four painters amassed enough work to cover nearly every wall in their Brighton apartment. The Nonantum Gallery is ever-expanding, now spanning multiple households as the artists create new homes with partners and decorate the houses of friends.</p>
